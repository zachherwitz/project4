## PROJECT OVERVIEW
The SAT Question Generator allows the user to prepare for their SAT exam by adding, editing, and viewing practice SAT questions. 

## APPROACH TAKEN

We began the project by laying the groundwork significantly with paired programming for the entire back-end and consistent collaboration for the front-end. All styling was made consistent through establishing set variables in layout, font, and color schemes, allowing for separation of design tasks without drifting into different styles. 

We planned this task, according to the two day time limit, with the philosophy "take something simple and do it well" in order to avoid scope creep.
